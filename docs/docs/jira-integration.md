# Jira Integration Guide

This document explains how to integrate the Clinical Trial Agile Tracker with Jira to manage sprints, user stories, and backlog items effectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Epics, Stories, Tasks:** Organize work hierarchically in Jira  
- **Sprint Boards:** Visualize sprint progress and velocity  
- **Workflows:** Customize Jira workflows to fit clinical trial processes

## Suggested Setup

1. Create a Jira project for the clinical trial program.  
2. Define Epics for major trial phases (e.g., Recruitment, Monitoring, Analysis).  
3. Break down Epics into User Stories and Tasks using the templates in this repo.  
4. Use Jira filters and dashboards to monitor progress and key metrics.

## Exporting Data

- Jira allows exporting issues to CSV format which can be imported into this repoâ€™s `data/` folder for analysis.  
- Automate data sync with APIs for real-time dashboards.

## Tips

- Use Jira Agile boards for sprint planning and retrospectives.  
- Link Confluence pages for documentation and team collaboration.
